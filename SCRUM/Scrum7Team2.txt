What have we worked on?
- Completed deliverable 2
- Completed Early Insights presentation
- preprocessed all the data by categories through the years 2005-2019
- made preliminary visualizations of trends in the data
- redefining project scope for deliverable 3 to focus on the key analysis questions


What will we be working on next?
- finish visualizations -- make more concise and focus on specific correlations
- run more linear regression models to see what else we can learn from the data
- deliverable 3

Have we run into any issues? 
- Some of the data for housing categories is not usable because of the values entered
- Not every year includes all 50 US states so this will be an issue that we will need to account for when we want to show trends in the 
    US as a whole 

Have we talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
- We met with the client on 11/19. 
- We are meeting with them Monday 11/22 to talk more about the data and what to focus on for deliverable 3 and 4
