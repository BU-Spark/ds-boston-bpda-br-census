What have we worked on?
- Searching for data about the census in Brazilians in Boston
- contacted project manager and professor Crovella about issue with finding and getting data from the client
- met with Client about issue collecting data

What will we be working on next?
- We received 2019 data on all states in the US from the cliebt
- we will be preprocessing this data from 2019 into a dataframe
- answering one analysis question about the data and making bar charts

Have we run into any issues? 
- Issue we are having is finding data about Boston, MA that specifies information for Brazilians specifically and not just Latin America as a whole
- Getting data from the client, reached out for several weeks but we have only received 2019 data (no years when the census was taken)

Have we talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
- We met with the client on Friday (10/22/21) expressed our issues and he said they will get the data we need to us during the week of 10/25
- We received the 2019 data from the client end of the day Wednesday 10/27/21 and they said we will recieve information for the years 2005-2018 
 but we have not received this information or an indication of when we will receive the years 2005-2018.
