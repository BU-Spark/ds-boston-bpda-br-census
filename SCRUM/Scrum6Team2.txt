What have we worked on?
- preprocessed all the data by categories through the years 2005-2019
- made preliminary visualizations of trends in the data
- redefining project scope for deliverable 2 to focus on the key analysis questions
- Completed deliverable 1
- Working on Early Insights presentation

What will we be working on next?
- finish visualizations 
- implement the ideas that we brainstormed and got approved by the client for manipulating the data

Have we run into any issues? 
- Some of the data for housing categories is not usable because of the values entered
- Not every year includes all 50 US states so this will be an issue that we will need to account for when we want to show trends in the 
    US as a whole 

Have we talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
- We met with the client on 11/5. We revised the scope of the project and received the data
- We will meet again 11/19 and we are in communication on slack.
