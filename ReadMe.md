# CS506-BPDA-Team 2

Repository containing code and reports related to Boston University's Spark Project Brazilian Community Census Analysis (CS 506) collaboration with Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA).
# Introduction

## Project Overview and Goal

Our goal is to analyze data from the US Census platform to track the Brazilian community demographic changes over the last 15 years in United States. The client expects us to tell a story about the Brazilian community and to apply our data science skills to explore and analyze the data so that client can perhaps learn new things about the Brazilian community or any trends that we see throughout the years of data we have on the Brazilian population in America. 

This could be done exploring what variables might correlate with others or running hypothesis tests to see if there might be some defining event that might have resulted in some change. The client wants visualizations created to contribute towards the insight and broader analysis on what the Brazilian community looks like and how it has changed over time.

# Dependencies
To process the data, we used **Pandas** and **NumPy**. To perform our analyses, we used the following Machine Learning libraries: **Sklearn**, **Scipy**, and **Statsmodel.API**. To produce our visualizations, we used **Matplotlib.Pyplot** and **Seaborn**. Please make sure you have the dependencies installed before running any code in this repository.

# How to Run Code

1. use jupyter notebook or google collab
2. depending on selected place to run the notebooks, import data files (in data folder) to the same directory/path as the notebook you are running (or update imports accordingly)
3. Some code produces csv where you can see the result there, others produce the results right below the cell
