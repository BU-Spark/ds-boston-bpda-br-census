## 1 Collect and pre-process a secondary batch of data

* Client  provided  data for the years 2005-2019.
* Extract State code and necessary data for plot.

## 2 Refine the preliminary analysis of the data

As client required, inorder to show differences between state and time by visualize the data.

* Plot data by year
  * Age
  * Gender
  * Marital Status
  * Citizenship
  * Year of Entry

  We show an example of plotting the change of Marital Status over years. The change of other attributes can also be easily visualized by inputting different parameters.

* Visualization graph that always shows the mast recent data.
* Show data for most top 10 popular states.
* Sort data in descending order.
* Add Sankey graph to show changes over time.
* Client wants using widgets to show partial (selected) data, hard to implement, need more discuss.
* Make the visualization of changes over years more interactable.
